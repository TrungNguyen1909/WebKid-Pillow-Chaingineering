This is an exploit for those three 35C3CTF challenges.

Huge thanks to Samuel Gro√ü (@5aelo) for his challenge and his awesome Int64 library.  

Also thanks to Linus Henze (@LinusHenze).

Also thanks to LiveOverflow for his awesome browser series.

Most of the code were based on Linus's WebKit-RegEx-Exploit and Samuel's exploit for CVE-2018-4233.  

Run `./server.py` to start a server hosting the exploit.
